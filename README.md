## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains 303 records and 14 features related to patient health. These include:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Serum Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG
- Max Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise Induced Angina
- ST Depression
- Peak Exercise ST Segment
- Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
- Diagnosis of Heart Disease (Target)

This dataset is widely recognized for benchmarking heart disease prediction models.

##‚≠ê Machine Learning Models Used

Several supervised learning models were trained and compared, including:

- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Naive Bayes  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

## üìà Model Evaluation

Each model was evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

- The **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model achieved the highest accuracy of **94.54%**.
- The evaluation involved hyperparameter tuning and a train-test split strategy.

###üìà Confusion Matrix (for KNN model):
- True Positives: 29
- True Negatives: 2
- False Positives: 1
- False Negatives: 3
